# Passwords

https://open.kattis.com/problems/passwords

Passwords is a string matching problem that is somewhat similar to kabobs. We are given a range of password lengths and a blacklist and are asked to count the valid passwords that are within the range of lengths, contain at least on upper, lower, and digit, and contain no items on the blacklist with common substitutions. It's clear that generating the strings and counting will take far too long, so our next look is to dynamic programming. We will have 3 directions to memoize on - length, bitmask of character types used so far, and whatever interesting prefix we might have. From each prefix we will move to each different character in our alphabet, apply the mask, and then find whatever new interesting prefix that we might have. For those items that have a prefix with a suffix matching a word we will make no forward moves and return 0. So, how can we find the interesting prefixes quickly? One way is reminiscent of Aho-Corsack string matching: we will essentially build an automaton storing the forward move locations for each character from each interesting prefix. We can do this by successively removing the first element of the new prefix until we find something that is in our automaton. Finally, instead of actually doing a memoized recursive search it's simpler and faster to just walk the automaton forward and keep a counts array.
