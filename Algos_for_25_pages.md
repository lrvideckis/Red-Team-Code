# 25 Pages Topics
The purpose of this document is to compile all useful code which we'll
use as our 25 pages.

Topics include algorithms in the old 25 pages.

## Math
 - extended gcd
 - chinese remainder theorem gcd inverse
 - fft
 - Row-reduction
 - geometry code in current 25 pages
 - (n choose k) mod p in O(log(10^18)) for prime p
 - fast exponentiation
 
## Graphs
 - max flow/min cut
 - all pairs shortest path
 - Strongly Connected Components (SCC) in directed graph (Kosaraju's Algo)

## String Algorithms
 - KMP string matching & Aho-Corasic FSM String multimatching
 - String edit distance
 - Suffix Array & LCP Array

## Data Structures
 - seg tree/fenwick tree
 - disjoint set
 - trie & binary trie
 - sparse table
 
## Advanced Topics (not sure if we should include these)
 - Euler Tours for a Tree
 - Least Common Ancestor in rooted tree
 - Maximum Matching in bipartite graphs
 - Sqrt Decomposition
 - Centroid Decomposition in tree
 - Persistant Seg Trees
 - 0-1 BFS (shortest path when weights are only 0,1)
 - Answering subtree queries in rooted tree
